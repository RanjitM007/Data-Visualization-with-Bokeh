Bokeh is a Python library for creating interactive visualizations for modern web browsers. It helps you build beautiful graphics, ranging from simple plots to complex dashboards with streaming datasets. With Bokeh, you can create JavaScript-powered visualizations without writing any JavaScript yourself.



With just a few lines of Python code, Bokeh enables us to create interactive, JavaScript-powered visualizations displayable in a web browser.

The basic idea of Bokeh is a two-step process: First, we select from Bokeh’s building blocks to create our visualization. Second, our customize these building blocks to fit your needs.

To do that, Bokeh combines two elements:

A Python library for defining the content and interactive functionalities of your visualization.

A JavaScript library called BokehJS that is working in the background to display your interactive visualizations in a web browser.

Based on our Python code, Bokeh automatically generates all the necessary JavaScript and HTML code for us. In its default setting, Bokeh automatically loads any additional JavaScript code from Bokeh’s CDN (content delivery network).
